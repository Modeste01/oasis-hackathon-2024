This was our team project at the 2024 WSU CrimsonCode Hackathon. 
The objective was to create a game that simulates conditions that migrants face as they cross the treacherous Sahara. 



In the code, I added variations to the messages that are displayed as events happen during gameplay.
Additionally, I discovered some of the sprites used in the game, worked on the dialog, and the song that plays during gameplay.
